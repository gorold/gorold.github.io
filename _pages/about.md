I'm currently a second year CS PhD candidate at Singapore Management University, advised by Assoc. Prof. Akshat Kumar. I am also very fortunate to be supported by the Salesforce Industrial PhD Programme (administered by Singapore's Economic Development Board). At Salesforce Research Asia, I am supervised by Chenghao Liu (Senior Applied Scientist), and Prof. Steven Hoi.

My current research interest lies in time-series modelling with neural networks, where I've worked on incorporating suitable inductive biases for time-series data such as trend and seasonality into the deep learning setting (self-supervised learning framework, model architecture, etc.).

I did my undergraduate studies in Singapore University of Technology and Design, and Singapore Management University under the SUTD-SMU Dual Degree Programme in Technology and Management.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, learning more about math/tech, eating good food, and exercising.

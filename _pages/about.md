I've just started a new job as a Research Scientist at Meta!

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Singapore Management University, advised by Assoc. Prof. Akshat Kumar. I was also very fortunate to be supported by the Salesforce Industrial Postgraduate Programme (administered by Singapore's Economic Development Board). At Salesforce AI Research Singapore, I was supervised by Chenghao Liu (Lead Applied Scientist).

<!-- My current research interest lies in time series modelling with neural networks, where I've worked on incorporating suitable inductive biases for time-series data such as trend and seasonality into the deep learning setting (self-supervised learning framework, model architecture, etc.). -->

I did my undergraduate studies in Singapore University of Technology and Design, and Singapore Management University under the SUTD-SMU Dual Degree Programme in Technology and Management.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, learning more about math/tech, eating good food, and exercising.
